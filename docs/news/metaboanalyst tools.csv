However, current tools were primarily developed to perform specific tasks in LC-MS based metabolomics data analysis. Here we introduce MetaboAnalystR 4.0 as a streamlined pipeline covering raw spectra processing, compound identification, statistical analysis, and functional interpretation. The key features of MetaboAnalystR 4.0 includes an auto-optimized feature detection and quantification algorithm for LC-MS1 spectra processing, efficient MS2 spectra deconvolution and compound identification for data-dependent or data-independent acquisition, and more accurate functional interpretation through integrated spectral annotation. Comprehensive validation studies using LC-MS1 and MS2 spectra obtained from standards mixtures, dilution series and clinical metabolomics samples have shown its excellent performance across a wide range of common tasks such as peak picking, spectral deconvolution, and compound identification with good computing efficiency.

Therefore, different scaling and normalization techniques are used to preprocess the data for metabolomics data analysis. Although several scaling methods are available in the literature, however, choice of scaling, transformation and/or normalization technique influences the further statistical analysis. It is challenged to choose the appropriate scaling technique for downstream analysis to get accurate results or to make proper decision. Moreover, the existing scaling techniques are sensitive to outliers or extreme values. To fill the gap, our objective is to introduce a robust scaling approach that is not influenced by outliers as well as provides more accurate results for downstream analysis. Here, we introduced a new weighted scaling approach that is robust against outliers; however, no additional outlier detection/treatment step is needed in data preprocessing and also compared it with the conventional scaling and normalization techniques through artificial and real metabolomics datasets. We evaluated the performance of the proposed method in comparison to the other existing conventional scaling techniques using metabolomics data analysis in both the absence and presence of different percentages of outliers. Results show that in most cases, the proposed scaling technique is a better performer than the traditional scaling methods in both the absence and presence of outliers. The proposed method improves the further downstream metabolomics analysis.

It aims to minimize sample-to-sample variations due to differences in the total metabolite amount. When samples lack a specific metabolic quantity to accurately represent their total metabolite amounts, post-acquisition sample normalization becomes essential. Despite many proposed normalization algorithms, understanding remains limited of their differences, hindering the selection of the most suitable one for a given metabolomics study. This study bridges this knowledge gap by employing data simulation, experimental simulation, and real experiments to elucidate the differences in the mechanism and performance among common post-acquisition sample normalization methods. Using public datasets, we first demonstrated the dramatic discrepancies between the outcomes of different sample normalization methods. Then, we benchmarked six normalization methods: sum, median, probabilistic quotient normalization (PQN), maximal density fold change (MDFC), quantile, and class-specific quantile. Our results show that most normalization methods are biased when there is unbalanced data, a phenomenon where the percentages of up- and downregulated metabolites are unequal. Notably, unbalanced data can be sourced from the underlying biological differences, experimental perturbations, and metabolic interference. Beyond normalization algorithms and data structure, our study also emphasizes the importance of considering additional factors contributed by data quality, such as background noise, signal saturation, and missingness. Based on these findings, we propose an evidence-based normalization strategy to maximize sample normalization outcomes, providing a robust bioinformatic solution for advancing metabolomics research with a fair quantitative comparison.","This study bridges the knowledge gap on post-acquisition sample normalization in untargeted metabolomics by comparing six methods, highlighting biases in unbalanced data and proposing an evidence-based strategy to maximize normalization outcomes for fair quantitative comparisons."

Previously reported approaches are either specific to one sample type or built on strong assumptions on data structure, which are limited to certain levels. This encouraged us to develop MAFFIN, an accurate and robust post-acquisition sample normalization workflow that works universally for metabolomics data collected on mass spectrometry (MS) platforms. Results MAFFIN calculates normalization factors using maximal density fold change (MDFC) computed by a kernel density-based approach. Using both simulated data and 20 metabolomics datasets, we showcased that MDFC outperforms four commonly used normalization methods in terms of reducing the intragroup variation among samples. Two essential steps, overlooked in conventional methods, were also examined and incorporated into MAFFIN. (i) MAFFIN uses multiple orthogonal criteria to select high-quality features for normalization factor calculation, which minimizes the bias caused by abiotic features or metabolites with poor quantitative performance. (ii) MAFFIN corrects the MS signal intensities of high-quality features using serial quality control samples, which guarantees the accuracy of fold change calculations. MAFFIN was applied to a human saliva metabolomics study and led to better data separation in principal component analysis and more confirmed significantly altered metabolites.

Data analysis and processing are major tasks due to the high complexity of generated signals and the presence of unwanted variations. In the present study, we introduce an R-based open-source collection of scripts called OUKS (Omics Untargeted Key Script), which provides comprehensive data processing. OUKS is developed by integrating various R packages and metabolomics software tools and can be easily set up and prepared to create a custom pipeline. Novel computational features are related to quality control samples-based signal processing and are implemented by gradient boosting, tree-based, and other nonlinear regression algorithms. Bladder cancer biomarkers discovery study which is based on untargeted LC-MS profiling of urine samples is performed to demonstrate exhaustive functionality of the developed software tool. Unique examination among dozens of metabolomics-specific data curation methods was carried out at each processing step. As a result, potential biomarkers were identified, statistically validated, and described by metabolism disorders. Our study demonstrates that OUKS helps to make untargeted LC-MS metabolomic profiling with the latest computational features readily accessible in a ready-to-use unified manner to a research community.","Omics Untargeted Key Script (OUKS) as mentioned in this paper is an R-based open-source collection of scripts, which provides comprehensive data processing for large-scale untargeted LC-MS-based metabolomic profiling."

A reliable and robust batch correction method removes unwanted systematic variations and improves the statistical power of metabolomics data, which undeniably becomes an important issue for the quality control of metabolomics. This study proposed a novel data normalization and integration method, Norm ISWSVR. It is a two-step approach via combining the best-performance internal standard correction with support vector regression normalization, comprehensively removing the systematic and random errors and matrix effects. This method was investigated in three untargeted lipidomics or metabolomics datasets, and the performance was further evaluated systematically in comparison with that of 11 other normalization methods. As a result, Norm ISWSVR decreased the data's median cross-validated relative standard deviation (cvRSD), increased the correlation between QCs, improved the classification accuracy of biomarkers, and was well-compatible with quantitative data. More importantly, Norm ISWSVR also allows a low frequency of QCs, which could significantly decrease the burden of a large-scale experiment. Correspondingly, Norm ISWSVR favorably improves the data quality of large-scale metabolomics data.","This study proposed a novel data normalization and integration method, Norm ISWSVR, which is a two-step approach via combining the best-performance internal standard correction with support vector regression normalization, comprehensively removing the systematic and random errors and matrix effects."

However, it shows large heterogeneity in sample concentration and consequently requires normalization to reduce unwanted variation and extract meaningful biological information. Biological samples like urine are commonly measured with electrospray ionization (ESI) coupled to a mass spectrometer, producing data sets for positive and negative modes. Combining these gives a more complete picture of the total metabolites present in a sample. However, the effect of this data merging on subsequent data analysis, especially in combination with normalization, has not yet been analyzed. To address this issue, we conducted a neutral comparison study to evaluate the performance of eight postacquisition normalization methods under different data merging procedures using 1029 urine samples from the Food Chain plus (FoCus) cohort. Samples were measured with a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FT-ICR-MS). Normalization methods were evaluated by five criteria capturing the ability to remove sample concentration variation and preserve relevant biological information. Merging data after normalization was generally favorable for quality control (QC) sample similarity, sample classification, and feature selection for most of the tested normalization methods. Merging data after normalization and the usage of probabilistic quotient normalization (PQN) in a similar setting are generally recommended. Relying on a single analyte to capture sample concentration differences, like with postacquisition creatinine normalization, seems to be a less preferable approach, especially when data merging is applied.",A neutral comparison study is conducted to evaluate the performance of eight postacquisition normalization methods under different data merging procedures using 1029 urine samples from the Food Chain plus (FoCus) cohort.

Many integrated multi-functional tools have been developed for untargeted metabolomics data processing and have been widely used. More alternative platforms are expected for both basic and advanced users. Integrated mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics data mining (IP4M) software was designed and developed. The IP4M, has 62 functions categorized into 8 modules, covering all the steps of metabolomics data mining, including raw data preprocessing (alignment, peak de-convolution, peak picking, and isotope filtering), peak annotation, peak table preprocessing, basic statistical description, classification and biomarker detection, correlation analysis, cluster and sub-cluster analysis, regression analysis, ROC analysis, pathway and enrichment analysis, and sample size and power analysis. Additionally, a KEGG-derived metabolic reaction database was embedded and a series of ratio variables (product/substrate) can be generated with enlarged information on enzyme activity. A new method, GRaMM, for correlation analysis between metabolome and microbiome data was also provided. IP4M provides both a number of parameters for customized and refined analysis (for expert users), as well as 4 simplified workflows with few key parameters (for beginners who are unfamiliar with computational metabolomics). The performance of IP4M was evaluated and compared with existing computational platforms using 2 data sets derived from standards mixture and 2 data sets derived from serum samples, from GCâMS and LCâMS respectively. IP4M is powerful, modularized, customizable and easy-to-use. It is a good choice for metabolomics data processing and analysis. Free versions for Windows, MAC OS, and Linux systems are provided.","The performance of IP4M was evaluated and compared with existing computational platforms using 2 data sets derived from standards mixture and 2 data set derived from serum samples, from GCâMS and LCâMS respectively."

While processing LC-MS/MS data through FBMN is fairly streamlined, downstream data handling and statistical interrogation is often a key bottleneck. Especially, users new to statistical analysis struggle to effectively handle and analyze complex data matrices. In this protocol, we provide a comprehensive guide for the statistical analysis of FBMN results. We explain the data structure and principles of data clean-up and normalization, as well as uni- and multivariate statistical analysis of FBMN results. We provide explanations and code in two scripting languages (R and Python) as well as the QIIME2 framework for all protocol steps, from data clean-up to statistical analysis. Additionally, the protocol is accompanied by a web application with a graphical user interface (https://fbmn-statsguide.gnps2.org/), to lower the barrier of entry for new users. Together, the protocol, code, and web app provide a complete guide and toolbox for FBMN data integration, clean-up, and advanced statistical analysis, enabling new users to uncover molecular insights from their non-targeted metabolomics data. Our protocol is tailored for the seamless analysis of FBMN results from Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking (GNPS and GNPS2) and can be adapted to other MS feature detection, annotation, and networking tools.","A comprehensive guide for the statistical analysis of Feature-Based Molecular Networks (FBMN) results from non-targeted metabolomics data.
